# Food_CPI_Annual_Change


This notebook, **Food Consumer Price Index (CPI) Annual Change Report (2023–2026)** by **Connor Chen**, explores how food price categories — **Eggs, Pork, Fresh Vegetables, Fresh Fruit, and Beef & Veal** — have changed over time and how their volatility compares within the U.S. food market.

The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in **annual percent change** and **forecasted CPI trends**, with special attention to **egg prices**, which have shown unusually large fluctuations due to factors like disease outbreaks and feed costs.

Designed for a **City Council audience**, this notebook translates technical economic data into accessible visual insights that inform policy discussions about food affordability and inflation communication. Each section includes clear visualizations, simplified explanations, and practical takeaways to support decision-making.
